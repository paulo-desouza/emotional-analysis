# emotional-analysis

Program to help visualize habits in your life. 

I have 3 attributes to each habit: Health, Active, and Fun

Using these the program builds a scatter chart using plotly. 


##Why?
Learning about how powerful data analysis is for companies to analyze their progress and reach their goal, 
I decided to start making efforts to collect and analyze my own life's data to assist me in my emotional 
growth and evolution.
